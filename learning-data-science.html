									<p>OEDSI’s mission is to promote increased use and understanding of educational data through a grassroots community. In order to successfully reach this vision, we must be able to provide those who wish to study this field with an opportunities to create these tools and understand the Data Science principles that power the Open Educational Data Science Initiative.</p>

									<p>For this reason, <b>education is at the heart of what we do.</b> While uncovering trends in educational policy, we also provide an educational opportunity for learners to advance their understanding of data literacy, data science, computer programming, machine learning and other fields. </p>

									<p>Here, we curate <b>free resources</b> for self-study and reference. The only aspect you can consider paying for are 3 recommended books or paying for additional features on some of the online courses. Through OEDSI’s contributors, we also promote online study-groups for those who seek to organize forums for tutorials, Q/As and other collaborative learning opportunities. Here are some sample resources we recommend browsing through on your learning journey.</p>

									<p>These websites offer a variety of free online classes. You may enroll in them at your own pace to study any of 1000s of subjects, wherever you are across the world.  </p>
									<p>edX, Udacity and Coursera allow you to take free individual courses, but ask you to pay for optional certifications (packages of courses). Codeacademy also offers a premium subscription that enables extra courses and increased support materials. However, you can study nearly all content on these online classes without any payments.</p>
									<p>edX and Coursera courses are based on courses designed by universities, while Udacity courses tend to be designed by technology companies emphasizing workplace skills and Codeacademy lessons are briefer learn-by-doing programming exercises. edX, Coursera and Udacity emphasize video lessons from instructors, with edX and Coursera often feature a longer video format similar to those seen in university classes.  </p>
									<p>Browse these websites and try some free courses. Pick the ones that best fit your preferred learning styles. Below, we list some recommended courses to consider.</p>

									<h2>Self-Study Tips: </h2>

									<p>Before we share more resources, here are some tips to maximize your self-studying journey.</p>

									<p><b>Have a schedule or study plan.</b> After you get into a grove of things, I recommend having expectations on how much time to allocate to completing activities. For example, maybe based on your other commitments you plan on completing a chapter each week by Friday and complete the chapter’s problem sets by Sunday. I recommend having a journal or calendar to map out your study plan and when you expect to complete each lesson or chapter.</p>
									<p><b>Take notes.</b> You will be learning a lot of interesting content and note-taking while allow you to better remember this information and structure these relationships between concepts. Paper notes are wonderful. Also consider taking electronic (typed) notes if you prefer, since these are easier to maintain - since they are accessible anywhere and can be searched easier. Consider using the Feynman method and making concise review guides after finishing each chapter or unit.</p>
									<p><b>Do problem sets!</b> If you are learning computer science or data science, there is no better way than doing than practicing being able to write and maintain code yourself. This also helps you grasp the proper syntax of programming languages and will reinforce your learning. At a certain point, you should program every day - even if they are small and simple scripts. Most of these linked books and online courses have problem sets you can complete.</p>
									<p><b>Talk over concepts</b> with a friend or a study group. Teaching, demonstrating, programming, diagramming and other active forms of learning are the most efficient ways to learn. If you have a friend or family member you can consistently review concepts with or ask questions to, this will help reinforce concepts deeper.</p>
									<p><b>Review periodically.</b> Look through your aforementioned notes and completed problem sets anytime you need to refresh your understanding. Having active conversations with others are also a great way to review. One of my favorite methods to review is diagramming concepts on a whiteboard and testing my ability to recall the key points of different data structures, statistical methods or book chapters; then annotating in another color concepts I either forgot or wrote incorrectly. To learn a topic deeply, is important to boost opportunities for revisiting and reviewing concepts to strengthen understanding over time.</p>

									<p>Included are a trio of insightful YouTube videos, an outstanding article from Harvard Business Review and an incredible interactive webpage explaining Machine Learning.  </p>
									<p>The first video explains data science in one minute, while the second video explains data science from a workplace perspective. The HBR article is co-written by DJ Patil, the first Chief Data Scientist of the United States and explains why data science is crucial for a firm’s ability to make complex and rational decisions.</p>
									<p>The third video shows an application of Machine Learning (ML) to video games. An artificial neural network is simulating a ‘human brain’ as it learns to beat Super Mario World through numerous trials and generations.  The second article does an incredible job in playfully walking us through an ML project through predicting house prices through other variables, demonstrating the concept of regression (that we also use in OEDSI), in a very interactive and visual approach.  </p>

									<p>If possible, I recommend taking a college-level statistics course. Doing so will help you understand certain concepts in greater detail. You can work through the Practical Statistics for Data Scientists book with or without taking a prior statistics course but some concepts may be harder to grasp. This book does an incredible job and explaining which statistics concepts are most relevant for Data Scientists and walking you through how to use them.  </p>
									<p>Python for Data Analysis walks through how to use key aspects of the most foundational Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and some others. Its first few chapters also review some basic concepts in Python programming, such as how to manipulate data types. It may be better to review this book after taking an Intro to CS class. At OEDSI, we do much of our data analysis through these Python libraries and Google Colab notebooks, so it is worth a deep introduction.</p>

									<p>These 2 resources walk you through your first programming experiences. You can chose to do any one of these first, after taking a CS class for additional review or skip them entirely to take your first Intro to CS class.  </p>
									<p>My favorite resource is HTLPTHW, which walks you through about 50 exercises that are brief and progressively show additional concepts in computational thinking and program organization. This series can be completed in 5-12 days and is a great first step in showing concepts to those who are new to programming. </p>
									<p>ATBS takes another and more advanced approach, by walking you through how to create scripts to automate everyday tasks - such as sending emails, text messages and organizing files. This is a great way to see the power of computers to automate repetitive tasks for us. I consider using this resource after you get more experience with Python and you want to hone your skills further.  </p>

									<p>This textbook and these 2 free online courses from MIT and Harvard University are incredible opportunities as Intro to CS classes. I recommend taking any one or two of these.</p>
									<p>This textbook does a wonderful job in walking us through the basic concepts of Computer Science and walking students through ways of manipulating the core data structures. This is my most recommended learning resource for new students. Make sure to do the problem sets at the end of each chapter!  </p>
									<p>These 2 edX courses are well-designed. Harvard CS50 is immensely popular and has a large online community. The only reason I don’t recommend it as highly as the MIT class is it focuses on the programming language C and not the Python language we primarily use in OEDSI - so I don’t recommend it for beginners who are just learning Computer Science and hope to contribute to OEDSI as soon as possible. These classes are great, give them both a look.</p>

									<p>For those who are interested in self-studying Computer Science at a much deeper time, these online resources walk learners through a self-study curriculum that models the core concepts and classes seen in a typical BS. Computer Science degree. These learning opportunities can also be completed for free and are suitable for learners of all ages.</p>
									<p>OSSU and teachyourselfcs.com walk through example course curricula that you can use as a reference on what online classes and study resources you can consider taking.  </p>
									<p>freeCodeCamp.org takes a different approach, offering a free online code bootcamp for those who seek a career change and aim to be immediately employable. It covers HTML, CSS and JavaScript most heavily and focuses on website development. It provides lessons explaining concepts and has learners complete projects such as creating websites to demonstrate job skills to potential employers. It is a high-quality and free alternative to other expensive bootcamps.</p>

									<h2>A Deeper Dive into Machine Learning: </h2>

									<p>For those who are more interested in Machine Learning, here are 2 great learning resources to start with. </p>
									<p>This book deeply covers the various ways to classify machine learning methods (Chapter 1 is phenomenal at explaining big picture concepts), example machine learning projects and ways to methods to boost model performance. The aforementioned Practical Statistics for Data Scientists book in a prior section also covers several of these topics in greater detail. Consider reading that book first if some of the approaches seem too abstract.  </p>
									<p>This Coursera course taught by Andrew Ng is a seminal Machine Learning course. It is considered one of the most popular online classes and is credited with exposing many to the field of ML. You can take it before or after working through the prior book.</p>

									<p>This Git course is very important to understand for aspiring software engineers. It comprehensively walks us through the concepts within version control, Git commands and why enabling and managing multiple versions of applications are so important in large software projects. As an open source project, this very important in understanding for the technology-focused contributors of OEDSI.  </p>
									<p>The above video shows how to use Jupyter notebooks and how these are used in sharing results in scientific analysis. We mostly use Google Colab notebooks which are very similar. The main difference is it has more Google doc-esque features for live collaboration and is easier to share and modify.</p>
									<p>HackerRank is an incredible website for more problems to practice. It is helpful for preparing for software engineering interviews or to practice solving problems in new programming languages. It is also a way for employers to evaluate your understanding through your results on evaluation problems they send to many applicants. This is a great way to simulate those interviews and screening processes to help you advance in your career.</p>
